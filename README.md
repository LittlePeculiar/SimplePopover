SimplePopover
=============

Cool but simple class to create UIPopover for selecting or filtering an array. Give it an array and get back an array of the selected items
See ViewController for creating UIPopoverController and calling class.
Add the following files:
FilterView.h, FilterView.m, FilterCell.h, FilterCell.m

Also includes background images for custom cells.
Will update ViewController for a more functional example (as time permits)
